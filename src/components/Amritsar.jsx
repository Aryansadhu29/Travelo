        <h1> Famous Places To Visit in Amritsar </h1>
        <ol>
          <li><b> The Golden Temple :</b> The Golden Temple is an inspiring place, and one that you can get personally involved with, if you wish. You can volunteer at the Golden Temple Kitchen, and bond with locals as you prepare lunch. You can also sleep at the Golden Temple in one of its pilgrim hostels for up to three nights. Sleeping here gives you easy access to the Golden Temple at sunrise–the best time of day to see the structure shine.<i><b>(Address:Golden Temple Road, Atta Mandi, Katra Ahluwalia, Amritsar)</b></i></li>
          <li><b>Wagah Border Ceremony :</b>A 31-kilometer drive west from the city center of Amritsar will take you to the border of Pakistan, where a curious border-closing ceremony takes place at sunset every afternoon. Full of pomp and circumstance, the Beating Retreat Ceremony involves an ostentatious display of goose-stepping guards from the Indian Border Security Force and the Pakistan Rangers saluting each other, lowering and folding their flags, and closing the gates at the border.<i><b>(Address: Wagah Border, National Highway 1 PB, Amritsar)</b></i></li>
          <li><b>Partition Museum :</b>The year 1947 was a big one for India. Not only was it the year that India gained its independence from Great Britain, it was also the year it split into the two different entities of India and Pakistan–an event known as the Partition of India.Tourists in Amritsar can learn about this defining moment in history at the Partition Museum, the only institution in the world devoted entirely to Partition.<i><b>(Address: Hall Road, Town Hall, Katra Ahluwalia, Amritsar)</b></i></li>
          <li><b>Jallianwala Bagh :</b>Tucked behind the Golden Temple, tourists will find another important site in Amritsar: Jallianwala Bagh. The public garden memorializes the estimated 1,500 people who were killed or injured when British soldiers were ordered to fire on peaceful protesters who were demanding the release of imprisoned leaders of the Indian Independence Movement in 1919. You can still see bullet holes in the walls that hundreds of victims hid behind in attempt to dodge the gunfire.<b>(<i>Address: Golden Temple Road, Jallan Wala Bagh, Katra Ahluwalia, Amritsar</i></b>)</li>
          <li><b>Khalsa College :</b>Architecture buffs, make a point to visit Khalsa College on Grand Trunk Road in Amritsar. The historic educational institution doubles as a premier example of 19th-century Indo-Saracenic architecture, a mash-up of Western European aesthetics with the exuberance of Indian and Persian styles.With elegant onion domes and scalloped archways, Khalsa College's palatial main building is impressive and has served as the setting of many Bollywood films. Spend some time wandering the tranquil campus and gardens, but keep in mind that the academic and administrative buildings are reserved exclusively for students and staff–this is still a working university, after all.<i><b>(Address: Grand Trunk Road, Putligarh, Amritsar)</b></i></li>
          <li><b>Hall Bazaar :</b>Step through Gandhi Gate to get a heavy dose of retail therapy at Hall Bazaar–the go-to place for souvenirs in Amritsar. Located in the heart of the city between the Golden Temple and the Partition Museum, this attraction is thought to be one of India's oldest markets. Its streets contain thousands of shops selling jewelry, textiles, tailored suits, electronics, and practically anything else you can imagine–at bargain prices, to boot!<i><b>(Address : Located in the heart of the city between the Golden Temple and the Partition Museum</b>)</i></li>

       <h1> Hidden Gems In Amritsar </h1> 
       <ol> 
         <li><b>Quila Ahluwalia :</b>  Although located just 100 metres from the Golden Temple, this fortress is ignored by most visitors. One of the five prominent forts in Amritsar, Quila Ahluwalia was built by Baba Jassa Singh Ahluwalia (1718-1783), a recognised Sikh leader of that time, as a base to visit the nearby Golden Temple easily and to take quick action in the course of an attack on the city or the shrine. However, only two of its gates and a small portion of the fort remain. Although the original architecture of the fort is missing, the colonial structures–which were later added–are in good condition.</li>
         <li><b>Summer Palace of Maharaja Ranjit Singh :</b>Situated in the historic Rambagh, popularly known as Company Bagh, the palace was opened to the public in February 2022 after fourteen years of conservation work. You can also visit the recently opened museum, where artefacts and weapons, including swords, daggers and rifles of the Maharaja Ranjit Singh era have been displayed for the public.</li>  
         <li><b>Gurudwara Guru Ka Mahal :</b>Situated at the main street of Guru Bazaar near the Golden Temple, this gurudwara was established in the 1500s by Guru Ram Das as his residence. The birthplace of Baba Atal Rai and Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur, it also served as the residence of Sri Guru Hargobind Singh. It was converted into a shrine by Guru Arjan Dev and his son, Guru Hargobind Singh.</li> 
         <li><b>Sarai Amanat Khan :</b>The Mughals built Sarai Amanat Khan as a sarai (resting place) on the Grand Trunk Road in a small village southwest of Amritsar. It was named after Amanat Khan, the calligrapher of the Taj Mahal, who is credited with inscribing verses from the Quran on the Taj Mahal.</li>
         <li><b>Pul Kanjri :</b>Pul Kanjri is a historical site situated 35km from Amritsar on the Amritsar-Lahore road, near the villages of Dhanoa Khurd and Dhanoa Kalan on the Wagah border. Built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, this is the place he used to rest at while travelling with his troops. This fortress also contains a bathing pool, a temple, a Gurudwara and a mosque.</li>
